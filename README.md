# Polynomial-Restrictor

## Description

Polynomial Restrictor is a GUI-based Python application developed using Tkinter for handling polynomials with modular arithmetic. The application allows users to input polynomial expressions, a field value (k), and partial assignments, then provides a restricted polynomial based on these inputs.

## Features

- **Polynomial Input:** Enter polynomials using variables and coefficients.
- **Field Value:** Specify a modular arithmetic field.
- **Partial Assignments:** Provide assignments for variables to restrict the polynomial.
- **Results Display:** View the restricted polynomial in the GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- No additional external libraries required

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepak-Kumar-1764/Polynomial-Restrictor.git
